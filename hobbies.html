                I really enjoy playing sports like tennis and I love playing videogames! Some of my favorite videogames are ROBLOX, Warzone, and Rainbow Six Siege.

                I also love coding during my free time as once you get the hang of it, it becomes really fun. Some advice I would give out to new coders is do not try to memorize coding. Rather think of it as learning a new skill like tying your shoes.
